 Contract-Reader       
 :        A Smart Contract Reader     b       Analysis Tool     -                   
   
Introduction 

Contract-Reader is a GitHub repository that provides a program to read and analyze smart contracts on EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) chains, identifying backdoors and potential harms to its users. 
This tool aims to help developers and security auditors ensure the security and integrity of their smart contracts.

Features

Backdoor Detection: The Contract-Reader tool can detect and alert users to potential backdoors in the smart contract code, such as unauthorized access or manipulation points.
Risk Assessment: The tool analyzes the contract code to identify potential vulnerabilities and security risks, enabling developers to proactively address them before deployment.

Code Review: Contract-Reader allows users to review the contract code, highlighting important sections and providing context to understand the contract's functionality and potential issues.

Compatibility: The tool supports popular EVM chains, including Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain (BSC), and Polygon (MATIC).

console.log("Hello World");
let name = "John";
let age = 30;
console.log(name);
console.log(age);

print("Hello World")
name = "John"
age = 30
print(name)
print(age)

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello World");
    String name = "John";
    int age = 30;
    System.out.println(name);
    System.out.println(age);
  }
}

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  cout << "Hello World" << endl;
  string name = "John";
  int age = 30;
  cout << name << endl;
  cout << age << endl;
  return 0;
}

using System;
class Main {
  static void Main(string[] args) {
    Console.WriteLine("Hello World");
    string name = "John";
    int age = 30;
    Console.WriteLine(name);
    Console.WriteLine(age);
  }
}
